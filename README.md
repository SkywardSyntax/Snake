# GitHub Codespaces ♥️ Next.js

Welcome to your shiny new Codespace running Next.js! We've got everything fired up and running for you to explore Next.js.

You've got a blank canvas to work on from a git perspective as well. There's a single initial commit with the what you're seeing right now - where you go from here is up to you!

Everything you do here is contained within this one codespace. There is no repository on GitHub yet. If and when you’re ready you can click "Publish Branch" and we’ll create your repository and push up your project. If you were just exploring then and have no further need for this code then you can simply delete your codespace and it's gone forever.

### How to Play

### Advanced Features

#### Levels

The game includes multiple levels that increase in difficulty as you progress. Each level introduces new challenges and obstacles to keep the gameplay engaging.

#### Power-ups

Collect power-ups to gain special abilities such as speed boost, invincibility, and more. Power-ups appear randomly on the grid and can be collected by the snake.

#### Multiplayer Support

Play with a friend in multiplayer mode. The second player can control their snake using the WASD keys. The game ends if either snake collides with the walls or their own body.
